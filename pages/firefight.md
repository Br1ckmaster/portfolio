<h2>Firefight!</h2>
<p>Firefight is an action puzzle, local co-op game, that has you play as two office workers escaping a burning office building by working together.<br>
Firefight is the first game that I have developed in Unreal Engine 4. Prior to that I had no experience in using the Unreal 4 Engine. It took approximately 5 months to create Firefight.<br></p>
<br>
<p>The other developers of Firefight are: <br>
Shane Dalton - Designer <br>
Hannah Holden - Character Artist <br>
Tassia Jaric - Environment Artist <br>
