<h2>Games/Projects I Have Worked On!</h2>

<div class="Cat Burglar">
<h3><u>Cat Burglar</u></h3>
<p>Cat Burglar is a stealth game, where the player must sneak around a house at night and search through the residentâ€™s belongings looking for valuable items to steal.<br>
<br>
This was the first game I worked on in a team. It took approximately 2 months to create Cat Burglar.<br>
<br>
I plan on reworking the entire game once I have completed my advanced diploma.
