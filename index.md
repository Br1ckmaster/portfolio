<h3><u>Cat Burglar</u></h3>
<p>Cat Burglar is a stealth game, where the player must sneak around a house at night and search through the residentâ€™s belongings looking for valuable items to steal.<br>
This was the first game I worked on in a team and it took approximately 2 months to create Cat Burglar.</p>
